# Project Name: Predict Taxi Fare with Random Forest

## About the Project

This project is a simulation of predicting taxi fares, but since we don’t have a taxi fare dataset handy, we’re using the California Housing dataset from scikit-learn as a substitute. The goal is the same: predict a continuous value (like fare) based on various features.

## Dataset

* We’re using the California Housing dataset, which comes built-in with scikit-learn.
* This dataset includes features like average income, house age, and location to predict housing prices.

## What You’ll Learn

* How to load and explore a dataset using Python
* How to prepare data for machine learning
* How to train a Random Forest model to make predictions
* How to evaluate your model’s performance

## Tools Used

* Python
* scikit-learn
* pandas
* matplotlib
* seaborn

## How to Run This Project

1. Clone this repository to your computer.
2. Install the required packages by running:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the script or notebook to train the model and see the results.

## What You’ll See

* A graph showing how well the model’s predictions match the actual values
* The mean squared error (MSE) which tells you how accurate the predictions are
